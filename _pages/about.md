<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>


I am currently a senior at Northeastern University in the Faculty of Robot Science and Engineering.

My research interest includes Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Neuromorphic Computing. 

I have won First Prize in the RoboMaster University Championship and First Prize in the RoboMaster Infantry Racing and Intelligent Shooting programs as a member of the T-DT Vision Group.

[Fully Spiking Neural Network for Legged Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05022)

**Xiaoyang Jiang**, **Qiang Zhang**, Jingkai Sun, Renjin Xu

[**Project**](https://github.com/thisisnotahuman/FullySNNforLeggedRobots) <!-- <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong> -->

- In this paper, we successfully apply a novel Spiking Neural Network (SNN) to process legged robots, achieving outstanding results across a range of simulated terrains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to implement SNN in legged robots.

[Saliency-Guided Hidden Associative Replay for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04334)

**Guangji Bai**, Qilong Zhao, Xiaoyang Jiang, Yifei Zhang, Liang Zhao

<!-- [**Project**](https://github.com/thisisnotahuman/FullySNNforLeggedRobots) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong> -->

- This paper presents the Saliency Guided Hidden Associative Replay for Continual Learning. SHARC primarily archives salient data segments via sparse memory encoding. Importantly, by harnessing associative memory paradigms, it introduces a content focused memory retrieval mechanism, promising swift and near-perfect recall, bringing CL a step closer to authentic human memory processes.

[Prompt, Plan, Perform: LLM-based Humanoid Control via Quantized Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11359)

**Jingkai Sun**, **Qiang Zhang**, Yiqun Duan, Xiaoyang Jiang, Chong Cheng, Renjing Xu

<!-- [**Project**](https://github.com/thisisnotahuman/FullySNNforLeggedRobots) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong> -->

- We present a novel approach that combines adversarial imitation learning with large language models (LLMs). This innovative method enables the agent to learn reusable skills with a single policy and solve zero-shot tasks under the guidance of LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that controls humanoid robots using a single learning policy network and LLM as a planner.
