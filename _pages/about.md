<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>


I am currently a master's student in Data Science at New York University.

I am interested in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. 

In addition, I have worked on projects related to Reinforcement Learning, Neuromorphic Computing (Spiking Neural Network), Continual Learning, Contrastive Learning and Large Language Models.

And I have Frosty ‚Äî the cutest little cat everüê±


<!-- I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->

[Fully Spiking Neural Network for Legged Robots](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10890793)

**Xiaoyang Jiang**, **Qiang Zhang**, Jingkai Sun, Jiahang Cao, Jingtong Ma, Renjing Xu

[**Project**](https://github.com/thisisnotahuman/FullySNNforLeggedRobots) <!-- <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong> -->

- In this paper, we successfully apply a lightweight population coded Spiking Neural Network (SNN) to process legged robots, achieving outstanding results across a range of simulated terrains. This study presents a highly efficient SNN for legged robots that can be seamless integrated into other learning models.
- Paper accepted for oral presentation at ICASSP 2025.

[Saliency-Guided Hidden Associative Replay for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04334)

**Guangji Bai**, Qilong Zhao, Xiaoyang Jiang, Yifei Zhang, Liang Zhao

<!-- [**Project**](https://github.com/thisisnotahuman/FullySNNforLeggedRobots) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong> -->

- This paper presents the Saliency Guided Hidden Associative Replay for Continual Learning. SHARC primarily archives salient data segments via sparse memory encoding. Importantly, by harnessing associative memory paradigms, it introduces a content focused memory retrieval mechanism, promising swift and near-perfect recall, bringing CL a step closer to authentic human memory processes.
- Accepted at NeurIPS 2023 Workshops.

[Prompt, Plan, Perform: LLM-based Humanoid Control via Quantized Imitation Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10610948)

**Jingkai Sun**, **Qiang Zhang**, Yiqun Duan, Xiaoyang Jiang, Chong Cheng, Renjing Xu

<!-- [**Project**](https://github.com/thisisnotahuman/FullySNNforLeggedRobots) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong> -->

- We present a novel approach that combines adversarial imitation learning with large language models (LLMs). This innovative method enables the agent to learn reusable skills with a single policy and solve zero-shot tasks under the guidance of LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that controls humanoid robots using a single learning policy network and LLM as a planner.
- Accepted at ICRA 2024.
